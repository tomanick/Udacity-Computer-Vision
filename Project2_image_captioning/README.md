# Project2 Image Captioning

## Project overview
In this project, you will use the dataset of image-caption pairs to train a CNN-RNN model to automatically generate images from captions.

## Project files
The project will be broken up into a few main parts in four Python notebooks:

Notebook 1 : Loading and Visualizing the Facial Keypoint Data

Notebook 2 : Defining and Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to Predict Facial Keypoints

Notebook 3 : Facial Keypoint Detection Using Haar Cascades and your Trained CNN

Notebook 4 : Fun Filters and Keypoint Uses

Models.py: The CNN-RNN architecture
